### React Native Starter Kit

Purpose of the boilerplate quick start for React Native App. We used TypeScript, React Context and Hooks, React Navigation V5.
The boilerplate includes finished components like (AppIntro), it's ready to use. And atomic components such as in compnents folder. It has really clean arhitecture, You can use your own project this boilerplate.

Folder architecture : 
/components -> Common Components
/Screens -> Screen which is ready for use
/Screens/SomeScreen/Components -> Uniqu Screen Components

Screen can have own Stack or not. It has examples.

If you want to see finished and served app from this boilerplate please wait :)
